create class QuickSort
function partition with HashMap hm, lower value and hiigher value as arguments
create new object instance temp,pivot of string class
pivot is the value of highest index hm element
i is assigned as the left list index pointer

loop while j less than h
if value at key:j is lesser than pivot
 increment i
 swap ith and jth element

swap i+1 th element and pivot (pivot is after left list)
return index of pivot (=i+1)



function QuickSort with arguments hm lower value and higher value
if l less than j
 j equals partition(hm,l,h) pivotal value
 QuickSort() for left of pivot array
 QuickSort() for right of pivot array


class Nebula
main() function
Object instance of QuickSort class is created
instance of generic class Hashmap with arguments as Key:Int and Value:String
sc object for input
value of n (number of elements) input
value of each element in hashmap input
Hashmap is updated in each iteration with new value

function QuicksSort() called with hm zero and n-1 as arguments

key and values of HashMap after Sorting are printed iteratively.
